"You are a helpful assistant. Please answer the question according to the given supporting facts. \n\n SUPPORT_FACTS:Fact1: Field goal percentage:Field goal percentage in basketball is the ""ratio"" of field goals ""made"" to field goals ""attempted"".  Its abbreviation is FG%.  Although three-point field goal percentage is often calculated separately, three-point field goals are included in the general field goal percentage.  Instead of using scales of 0 to 100%, the scale .000 to 1.000 is commonly used.  A higher field goal percentage denotes higher efficiency.  In basketball, a FG% of .500 (50%) or above is considered a good percentage, although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions.  Guards usually have lower FG% than forwards and centers. Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player, but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots.  In the NBA, Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG% (around .580) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks. Guard Allen Iverson often had a low FG% (around .420) because he took the bulk of his team's shot attempts, even with high difficulty shots.; Fact2: Allen Iverson:Allen Ezail Iverson (born June 7, 1975) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

From Junction 9 (A34) near Winchester, to Junction 14 (M27) on the northern fringe of Southampton, the M3 forms the southerly part of the unsigned E05.  It was constructed as a dual three-lane motorway for most of its length, except for the two-lane section between Junctions 8 (A303) and 9.  The motorway was opened in phases, beginning with the first section (Junction 3 to 8) in 1971.  It was eventually completed in 1995 on completion of the Junction 10 to 12 section, which faced widespread opposition because of its route through Twyford Down: numerous road protests were held during construction, which ultimately delayed its opening.  Since then, the motorway has become a major artery to the South Coast, becoming a popular tourist route.  Consequently, the M3 faces regular delays and congestion on its busiest sections during rush hours and seasonal periods.  The Junctions 2 to 4A section is currently being upgraded to a Smart Motorway, which will turn the hard shoulder into a fourth lane to provide extra capacity.; Fact2: European route E05:The European route E 05 is part of the United Nations international E-road network.

They were established by supporters of The Bongo Club, a non-profit Edinburgh venue, in opposition to the high-profile Perrier Awards (now the Edinburgh Comedy Awards).  The name tap water contrasts with Perrier, a brand of bottled water owned by Nestlé.  The opposition was part of The Bongo Club's broader participation in the Nestlé boycott, a global protest at Nestlé's allegedly excessive promotion of breast-milk substitutes in developing countries to the detriment of infant health.  In 2006 Perrier withdrew from sponsoring the Edinburgh Comedy Awards and the Tap Water Awards have not been held since.\n\nFact2: Nestlé boycott:A boycott was launched in the United States on July 7, 1977, against the Swiss-based Nestlé corporation.

Organizers of the boycott encourage the practice of newborn nutrition via natural breast milk and claim that use of the substitutes represent a health risk for infants.  As of 2013, the Nestlé boycott is coordinated by the ""International Nestlé Boycott Committee"", the secretariat for which is the UK group ""Baby Milk Action"". \n\n QUESTION:What did The Bongo Club participated in in the United States on July 7, 1977? \n\n Answer:  The Bongo Club participated in the launch of a boycott against the Swiss-based Nestlé corporation in the United States on July 7, 1977.",1
