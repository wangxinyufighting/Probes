"You are a helpful assistant. Please answer the question according to the given supporting facts. \n\n SUPPORT_FACTS:Fact1: Santa Claus in film:Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called ""Santa Claus Filling Stockings"", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called ""Santa Claus and the Children"" was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled ""Santa Claus"" (or ""The Visit from Santa Claus"" in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  ""Santa Claus' Visit"" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled ""A Trap for Santa Claus"" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled ""Santa Claus"", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled ""Santa Claus"" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.
